## Key Features

* **ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Generation**: Integrates with transformer-based AI models (like GPT) to interpret natural language prompts and generate high-quality React component code.
* **âš¡ Real-Time Previews**: A sleek React frontend allows users to input prompts and immediately preview the generated components.
* **ðŸ”Œ Robust Backend API**: A dedicated backend processes user input and communicates with AI inference services to fetch the generated code.
* **âœ¨ User-Friendly Design**: A strong focus on UI/UX provides instant feedback, beautiful code syntax highlighting, and one-click copy/download functionality.
* **ðŸ“š Detailed Documentation**: Comprehensive guides covering the AI model integration, component lifecycle, and instructions for extending the system.

## How It Works

The application follows a simple yet powerful workflow to turn a text prompt into a functional React component.



1.  **User Input**: The user types a description of the desired component into the web interface (e.g., "A user profile card with an avatar, name, and bio").
2.  **API Request**: The React frontend sends the prompt to the backend API.
3.  **AI Inference**: The backend securely calls an external AI model, sending the user's prompt wrapped in a system message engineered for code generation.
4.  **Code Generation**: The AI model processes the request and generates the React component code as a string.
5.  **API Response**: The backend sends the generated code back to the frontend.
6.  **Render & Preview**: The frontend displays the formatted, syntax-highlighted code and (if applicable) renders a live preview of the component.

## Tech Stack

This project is a full-stack application built with modern technologies.

* **Frontend**:
    * **React**: For building the user interface.
    * **Vite**: As the frontend tooling and development server.
    * **Axios**: For making API requests.
    * `react-syntax-highlighter`: For beautiful code formatting.

* **Backend**:
    * **Node.js**: As the JavaScript runtime.
    * **Express.js**: As the API framework.
    * `openai` or `langchain`: To interact with the AI model API.
    * `cors`, `dotenv`: For middleware and environment management.

## Installation & Setup

To run this project locally, you will need to set up both the backend and frontend services.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ai-component-generator.git](https://github.com/your-username/ai-component-generator.git)
    cd ai-component-generator
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `/server` directory and add your AI provider's API key:
    ```ini
    # server/.env
    PORT=3001
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_secret_api_key_here"
    ```

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run Both Services Concurrently:**
    For the best development experience, use a tool like `concurrently`. Add the following script to the root `package.json`:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "concurrently \"npm run dev --prefix client\" \"npm start --prefix server\""
    }
    ```
    Now you can start both frontend and backend with a single command from the root directory:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

---

## Usage

After running the `npm run dev` command:

1.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or your configured Vite port).
2.  You will see the main interface with a text input area.
3.  Type a description of the component you want to create. Be descriptive!
    * *Good Prompt*: "A responsive navigation bar with a logo on the left and links for Home, About, and Contact on the right."
    * *Simple Prompt*: "A button with a blue background."
4.  Click the "Generate" button.
5.  The generated code will appear in the code display area, and you can copy it using the provided button.

## Roadmap

Future plans to enhance the AI Component Generator include:

-   [ ] **Stateful Components**: Expand generation capabilities to support state management (`useState`, `useEffect`) and complex props.
-   [ ] **Multi-Framework Support**: Add support for generating components for other popular frameworks like **Vue** and **Angular**.
-   [ ] **User Accounts & Libraries**: Implement user authentication to allow users to save, manage, and share their generated components.
-   [ ] **Context-Aware Refinements**: Allow users to provide feedback or additional prompts to refine an already-generated component.
